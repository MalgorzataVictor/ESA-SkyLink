# SkyLink Airlines – Enterprise Systems Architecture

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers a **layered reference architecture** for SkyLink Airlines, a global airline operating passenger and cargo flights. The architecture addresses **operational efficiency, safety, scalability, and customer experience** through modern enterprise design principles.

The solution includes:
- **Information Architecture**: Data models, master data management, and metadata catalog.
- **Application Architecture**: Microservices, API contracts, and user workflows.
- **Integration & Middleware**: Patterns for real-time telemetry, batch ETL, and API gateways.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Security, resilience, scalability, and observability.
- **Deployment Topology**: Cloud, on-premises, and edge computing strategies.

## 🛠 Key Features
- **Microservices Design**: Reservation, Check-in, Flight Tracking, Maintenance, Crew Scheduling.
- **API Contracts**: REST endpoints for booking and check-in, MQTT for ADS-B telemetry.
- **Data Models**: Conceptual, Logical, and Physical models for airline operations.
- **Integration Patterns**: Streaming for telemetry, CDC for CRM sync, Batch ETL for analytics.
- **Security Model**: TLS encryption, VPN over SATCOM, network segmentation.
- **Scalability & Observability**: Kubernetes, sharding, ELK stack, Prometheus, distributed tracing.
